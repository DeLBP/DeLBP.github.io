{"name":"DeLBP","tagline":"Workshop on Declarative Learning Based Programming","body":"The main goal of Declarative Learning Based Programming (DeLBP) workshop is to investigate the raising issues when designing and using programing languages that support learning from data and knowledge. \r\n\r\nDeLBP aims at facilitating and simplifying the design and development of intelligent real world applications that use machine learning and reasoning by addressing the following commonly observed challenges:\r\nInteraction with messy, naturally occurring data; Specifying the requirements of the application at a high abstraction level; Dealing with uncertainty in data and knowledge in various layers of the application program; Using representations that support flexible relational feature engineering; Using representations that support flexible reasoning and structure learning; Integrating a range of learning and inference algorithms; and finally addressing the above mentioned issues in one unified programming environment.\r\n\r\nConventional programming languages offer no help to application programmers that attempt to design\r\nand develop applications that make use of real world data, and reason about it in a way that involves\r\nlearning interdependent concepts from data, incorporating existing models, and reasoning about existing\r\nand trained models and their parametrization. Over the last few years the research community has tried to address these problems from multiple perspectives, most notably, various approaches to Probabilistic programming, Logical Programming and the integrated paradigms. The goal of this workshop is to present and discuss the current related research and the way various challenges have been addressed. We aim at motivating the need for further research toward a unified framework in this area based on the key existing paradigms: \r\nProbabilistic Programing (PP),  Logic Programming (LP),  Probabilistic Logical Programming (PLP),  First order query languages and database management systems (DBMS) and deductive databases (DDB),  Statistical relational learning and related languages (SRL), and connect these to the ideas of Learning Based Programming.  \r\n\r\nWe aim to discuss and investigate the required type of languages and representations that facilitate modeling probabilistic or non-probabilistic complex learning models, and provide the ability to combine, chain and perform flexible inference with existing models and by exploiting first order background knowledge.\r\n\r\n## Topics\r\n- Data modeling (Relational data modeling or Graph based)\r\n- First order Knowledge Representation\r\n- Relational feature engineering\r\n- Design and Representation of complex Learning and Inference Models \r\n- Probabilistic Programming \r\n- Probabilistic Logical Learning and Reasoning\r\n- Declarative Languages\r\n- Automation of Typer-Parameter Tuning \r\n- Applications in Natural language processing, Computer vision and Bioinformatics\r\n\r\nWe encourage contributions in any of these areas with either a technical paper (AAAI style, 6 pages without references) or a position statement (AAAI style, 2 pages maximum).
