<h2>Overview</h2>

<h4>Demand for real world applications</h4>
<p>Nowadays, to solve real-world problems in many areas such as cognitive sciences, biology, finance,  physics, social sciences, etc,  scientists think about data-driven solutions to a progressively increasing extent. 
<h4>Challenge for domain experts</h4>
However, current technologies offer cumbersome solutions along multiple dimensions. Some of this include, 

Interaction with messy naturally occurring data;
Necessity for expertise in CS and extensive programming; Necessity of exploiting various learning  paradigms and techniques; and Extensive experimental exploration for model selection, feature selection, parameter tuning due to the lack of theoretical evidence about the effectiveness of various models.</p>

<h4>
High-level goal and implied directions</h4>
<p>DeLBP workshop aims at highlighting the issues and challenges that arise for having a declarative data driven problem-solving paradigm.
This paradigm facilitates and simplifies the design and the development of intelligent real world applications that consider learning from data and reasoning based on knowledge.  It highlights the challenges in making machine learning accessible to various users including non-CS-experts and application programmers.
</p>
<p>
Conventional programming languages have not been primarily designed to offer help for the above-mentioned challenges.  To Achieve the DeLBP goals there is a need to go beyond designing tools for classic machine learning  by enriching the existing solutions and frameworks with the capabilities in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong> Specifying </strong> the requirements of the application at a high abstraction level; 
<strong>Exploiting</strong> the expert knowledge in learning;
<strong>Dealing</strong> with uncertainty in data and knowledge in various layers of the application program; Using representations that support flexible relational feature engineering; 
<strong>Using</strong> representations that support flexible reasoning and structure learning; 
<strong>Ability</strong> to reuse, combining and chaining models and perform flexible inference on complex models or pipelines of decision making;
<strong>Integrating</strong> a range of learning and inference algorithms; 
<strong>Closing</strong> the loop of moving from data to knowledge and exploiting knowledge to generate data; <strong>and</strong> finally having a unified programming environment to design application programs. 
</p>
<p>
<h4>Related communities</h4> 
Over the last few years the research community has tried to address these problems from multiple perspectives, most notably various approaches based on Probabilistic programming (PP), Logical Programming (LP), Constrained Conditional models (CCM) and other integrated paradigms such as Probabilistic Logical Programming (PLP) and Statistical relational learning (SRL). These paradigms  and related languages aim at learning over probabilistic structures and exploiting knowledge in learning.
We aim at motivating the need for further research toward a unified framework in this area based on the above mentioned key existing paradigms as well as other related research such as First-order query languages, database management systems (DBMS), deductive databases (DDB), hybrid optimization for learning from data and knowledge. We are interested in connecting these ideas towards developing a Declarative Learning Based Programming Paradigm and investigate the required type of languages, representations and computational models to support such a paradigm. </p>




  <!--    <p>The main goal of Declarative Learning Based Programming (DeLBP) workshop is to investigate the issues that arise when designing and using programming languages that support learning from data and knowledge. </p>

<p>DeLBP aims at facilitating and simplifying the design and development of intelligent real world applications that use machine learning and reasoning by addressing the following commonly observed challenges:
Interaction with messy, naturally occurring data; Specifying the requirements of the application at a high abstraction level; Dealing with uncertainty in data and knowledge in various layers of the application program; Using representations that support flexible relational feature engineering; Using representations that support flexible reasoning and structure learning; Integrating a range of learning and inference algorithms; and finally addressing the above mentioned issues in one unified programming environment.</p>


<p>Conventional programming languages offer no help to application programmers that attempt to design and develop applications that make use of real world data, and reason about it in a way that involves learning interdependent concepts from data, incorporating existing models, and reasoning about existing and trained models and their parametrization. Over the last few years the research community has tried to address these problems from multiple perspectives, most notably various approaches based on Probabilistic programming, Logical Programming and the integrated paradigms. The goal of this workshop is to present and discuss the current related research and the way various challenges have been addressed. We aim at motivating the need for further research toward a unified framework in this area based on the key existing paradigms: 
Probabilistic Programing (PP),  Logic Programming (LP),  Probabilistic Logical Programming (PLP),  First-order query languages and database management systems (DBMS) and deductive databases (DDB),  Statistical relational learning and related languages (SRL), and connect these to the ideas of Learning Based Programming.  </p>

<p>We aim to discuss and investigate the required type of languages and representations that facilitate modeling probabilistic or non-probabilistic complex learning models, and provide the ability to combine, chain and perform flexible inference with existing models and by exploiting first-order background knowledge.</p> -->

<p> <strong>Title: PSDDs for Tractable Learning in Structured and Unstructured Spaces</strong>

<p>Abstract:

In this talk, I will discuss two related settings for learning a probabilistic model from data. In the first setting, called tractable learning, we are given a standard dataset and the goal is to learn a distribution that allows for efficient inference. This setting received a lot of attention recently, and is often tackled by learning a circuit representation of the distribution. In the second setting, which has not been treated as systematically before, one has access to Boolean constraints that characterize examples known to be impossible (e.g., due to known domain physics). The task is then to learn a probabilistic model over this structured space that is guaranteed to assign a zero probability to each impossible example.
I will describe a new class of Arithmetic Circuits, the PSDD, for addressing both classes of learning problems. The PSDD is based on advances from both machine learning and logical reasoning and can be learned under Boolean constraints. It achieves state-of-the-art results, both in tractable learning from standard datasets, and in structured probability spaces, such as rankings and combinatorial objects. I will additionally show how PSDDs can be learned from a new type of incomplete datasets, in which examples are partially specified using arbitrary Boolean expressions.

<p><strong> Title: Declarative Data Science
</strong></p><p>
Abstract: abstract: Data science has become essential for the operations of every business. Unfortunately data science follows the excel syndrome when it is seen from the database perspective. Although the data is usually normalized in a relational database, when it is time to be used in a machine learning model denormalization is required in ordered to be fed to the algorithms. This widely adopted practice has two problems. First it can convert a small data problem to a big data problem and second it ignores the relational nature of the data that might be important for the machine learning model. In this talk we will see how we can develop fast algorithms inside the database by leveraging the relational model. Based on some recent join algorithms we show that even with the database overhead it is much faster to process the data inside the database rather than exporting it and using high performance computing. We also demonstrate how we can use Linear Programming as a framework in doing data science inside the database and how this can supercharge the process of model development.

<p><strong>Declarative constraint-based pattern mining: from modeling to solving</strong>
<p>
Abstract: In todays data-rich world, pattern mining techniques allow us to extract knowledge from data. However, such knowledge can take many forms and often depends on the application at hand. This calls for generic techniques that can be used in a wide range of settings. Declarative constraint-based mining offers an answer to this question.
By building on constraint programming solvers, a generic method that fits many pattern mining settings is obtained. However, there is a trade-off between generality and efficiency. This talk will discuss multiple efforts to reduce the trade-off, both at the modeling level and at the solving level.

<p> Bio: Tias Guns is Assistant Professor at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), in the Business, Technology and Operations lab of the faculty of Economic and Social Sciences & Solvay Business School. His research lies on the border between data mining and constraint programming, and his main interest is in integrating domain expertise and user constraints into data analytics tasks. As part of his PhD, he has developed the CP4IM framework which showed for the first time the potential of using constraint programming for pattern mining. His PhD was awarded with both the constraint programming dissertation award and the ECCAI artificial intelligence dissertation award. He is an active member of the community and has organized a number of workshops and a special issue on the topic of combining constraint programming with machine learning and data mining.
