<h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The main goal of Declarative Learning Based Programming (DeLBP) workshop is to investigate the issues that arise when designing and using programming languages that support learning from data and knowledge. </p>

<p>DeLBP aims at facilitating and simplifying the design and development of intelligent real world applications that use machine learning and reasoning by addressing the following commonly observed challenges:
Interaction with messy, naturally occurring data; Specifying the requirements of the application at a high abstraction level; Dealing with uncertainty in data and knowledge in various layers of the application program; Using representations that support flexible relational feature engineering; Using representations that support flexible reasoning and structure learning; Integrating a range of learning and inference algorithms; and finally addressing the above mentioned issues in one unified programming environment.</p>


<p>Conventional programming languages offer no help to application programmers that attempt to design and develop applications that make use of real world data, and reason about it in a way that involves learning interdependent concepts from data, incorporating existing models, and reasoning about existing and trained models and their parametrization. Over the last few years the research community has tried to address these problems from multiple perspectives, most notably various approaches based on Probabilistic programming, Logical Programming and the integrated paradigms. The goal of this workshop is to present and discuss the current related research and the way various challenges have been addressed. We aim at motivating the need for further research toward a unified framework in this area based on the key existing paradigms: 
Probabilistic Programing (PP),  Logic Programming (LP),  Probabilistic Logical Programming (PLP),  First-order query languages and database management systems (DBMS) and deductive databases (DDB),  Statistical relational learning and related languages (SRL), and connect these to the ideas of Learning Based Programming.  </p>

<p>We aim to discuss and investigate the required type of languages and representations that facilitate modeling probabilistic or non-probabilistic complex learning models, and provide the ability to combine, chain and perform flexible inference with existing models and by exploiting first-order background knowledge.</p>

  <h4>Title: The Democratization of Optimization</h4>
 
<p>ABSTRACT. Democratizing data does not mean dropping a huge spreadsheet on everyone’s desk and saying, “good luck,”
it means to make data mining, machine learning and AI methods useable in such a way that people can
easily instruct machines to have a „look" at the data and help them to understand and act on it. 
A promising approach is the  declarative “Model + Solver” paradigm that was and is behind many revolutions in
computing in general: instead of outlining how a solution should be computed, we specify what the problem 
is using some modeling language and solve it using highly optimized solvers. Analyzing data, however, involves more 
than just the optimization of an objective function subject to constraints. Before optimization can take place, a large effort 
is needed to not only formulate the model but also to put it in the right form. We must often build models before we know 
what individuals are in the domain and, therefore, before we know what variables and constraints exist. Hence modeling 
should facilitate the formulation of abstract, general knowledge. This not only concerns the syntactic form of the model but 
also needs to take into account the abilities of the solvers; the efficiency with which the problem can be solved is to a large 
extent determined by the way the model is formalized. In this talk, I shall review our recent efforts 
on relational optimisation. It can reveal the rich logical structure underlying many AI 
and data mining problems both at the formulation as well as the optimization level. Ultimately, it will make optimization 
several times easier and more powerful than current approaches and is a step towards achieving the grand challenge 
of automated programming as sketched by Jim Gray in his Turing Award Lecture.</p>

<h4>Title: Probabilistic Soft Logic: A Scalable, Declarative Approach to Structured Prediction from Noisy Data</h4>

<p>ABSTRACT. A fundamental challenge in developing impactful artificial intelligence technologies is balancing the ability to
  model rich,structured domains with the ability to scale to big data. Many important problem areas are both richly structured and
  large scale, including social and biological networks, knowledge
  graphs and the Web, computer vision and natural language. In this
  talk, I will introduce Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), a declarative probabilistic
programming language that is able to both capture rich structure and
scale to big data. The mathematic framework upon which PSL is based,
hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of
probabilistic graphical model that generalizes three different
approaches to inference.  The three views come from the randomized
algorithms community (round probabilities), the graphical models
community (local consistency relaxations), and the fuzzy logic

community (Lukasiewicz t-norms).  I show that all three views lead to

the same inference objective, and that this inference objective is

convex, leading to highly efficient inference algorithms.  I describe

extensions to learning to support latent variables, which enable

HL-MRFs to capture even richer dependencies.  Along the way, I

describe results in a variety of different domains.</p>

Joint work with Stephen Bach, Bert Huang, Matthias Broechler and other

members of the LINQs research group.
